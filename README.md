# Eyes Demo

### Description

This is the eyes demo.  The two eyes follow the cursor around the screen.  A random amount of time, from 500ms to 5500ms the eyes will blink.


### How to run

Open up index.html, move the cursor around, watch the eyes follow the cursor around, and try to catch them blinking.


### Future Improvements

Future improvements include different eye colors, or maybe the eyes getting red and sore if the demo is run long enough.
